# TODO List

TODO List is a simple web app which enables it's users to create, list, update, delete and filter their TODO tasks.
Users have to be registered into system to make these actions. Each TODO task is described by it's name, desciption, duration, deadline, status (planned, in progress, finished) and category.
Category describes task little bit more with it's name (shopping, school...), default duration and color (something like colorful papersticks on walls). Some categories like school, workout, shopping already exists in app, but users can create their own default categories used for creating new tasks.
Users also can filter in list of their tasks on various criteria (task's status, category, progress ...).
App also enables switching between two modes, light and dark.
